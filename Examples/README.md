# Examples


## pulpy2ban

Inspired by [Fail2Ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) this examples blocks all requests from a source that was deemed to be "malicous" for x amount of time where x increase exponentially everytime a "malicous" request occurs.

to run:


```$ python pulpy2ban.py ```

## One-hop DHT



A one hop dht (highly simplified), inspired by [One-hop](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/gupta/gupta_html/). 

Each machine is responsible for an ID range and if a request is not for their id the machine will forward it to the correct machine.

Each machine knows the location of all other machines.

to run:


```$ python oneHop.py ```

### Valiantly routing One-hop DHT

To turn your One-hop DHT to a \<valiant\> many random hops prior system run:


```$ python oneHop.py v=<valiant>```

ex.


```$ python oneHop.py v=1```  
	--> sends requests to one random machine prior to the correct one.

## Shower

This simulates multiple showers and multiple users trying to adjust the temperatures to their preffered temperatures. Each user can have access to any amount of the showers.

Users can only say hotter or colder, additionally they have to work against others' wishes if they have a different preffered temperatures.

If they all agree, or are close to agreeing, on the ideal temperature this usually settles itself relativly quickly:

Unlike when they do not:

To run:

```$ python shower.py```

with graph:

```$ python shower.py -g```

with close preferred temperatures:

```$ python shower.py -c```

## Periodic

Periodic uses the PeriodicSource class to generate for every item a request every x time units where x is chosen randomly. 

to run:

```$ python periodic.py ```
